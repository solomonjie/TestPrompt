Routine tasks such as data wrangling and pipeline maintenance often inhibit data teams from doing higher-value analysis and insights-led decision-making. This session showcases how intelligent data agents in BigQuery can help automate complex data engineering tasks. Youâ€™ll learn how to use natural language prompts to streamline data engineering tasks from ingestion and transformation, such as data cleaning, formatting, and loading results into BigQuery tables that accelerate the time to build and validate data pipelines
